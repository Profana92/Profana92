<p>I enjoy everything development-related, from coding to hosting my projects online on my Linux server. 
I am curious about everything that goes with tech, and it constantly keeps coming towards me, I love it!  </p>

<p>Redis? And it all started with a simple pattern, WordPress? Let me check it out and see if it is fun and well... 
YES it is. I can't set my own php.ini and I need a longer PHP execution time, that's a pain, let's find out how to do that.
Oh, a VPS should help, but it is Linux-based... I want to know how to operate that! </p>

Ok, I have my website how I wanted it, but it is too slow when getting data from the database, let's look for a solution. Memcached?
No, obsolete they say. Oh, Redis, let's go with that. Can I rebuild the website to use MariaDB instead of MySQL and still use WordPress?
Yeah, I do! Ok, that's very cool, but I struggle with content, styles, responsiveness, and every time I see .js I have no clue about what is going on.
That needs to be changed. I need to buy some books, watch tutorials, write code and learn.
But how to find out how to style elements to look nice? It's worth giving Adobe XD and Figma a try, maybe those can help?
What I want to say is it is a constant loop of questions and answers and I love it. 
There is still React to learn, D3.js, and I want to make a simple game with HTML canvas element and JavaScript. 
Then a mobile app - so React Native is a must-have. 
There is a very long path to get to know all those things and to use them with proficiency I want to use them with, 
but as one of my favorite quotes states: "The question is never 'why' it is always 'how'." and that "how" is what I want to know.
